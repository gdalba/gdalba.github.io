  This paper emerges as a follow up from my presentation at the 2016 Canada International Conference on Education (https://ciceducation.org/). The large amount of scientific information
  available nowadays challenges the capacity of students to deal appropriately with it. This may result
  in a loss of interest on the subject and, thus, create a gap between scientific ideas and the students. In order to avoid this, didactic transposition and interdisciplinary methods might bring in new thoughts on how science education can be improved. In this paper, we discuss the application of those ideas by using Bioinformatics as an example, as it has been an emerging field that is based on interdisciplinary approaches. By improving the teaching of complex ideas and theories, it is possible that the studentâ€™s relationship with science, as well as with the educators, may be improved.
