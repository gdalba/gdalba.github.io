  Prokaryotic gene transcription is tightly regulated, with σ factors like σ28 guiding RNA polymerase to specific promoters related to bacterial motility and pathogenicity. This study applied k-means clustering to group E. coli promoter sequences recognized by σ28 and analyzed the clusters using WebLogo, STRING-DB, and Gene Ontology. The resulting clusters showed promoter sequence compositions that diverge from the canonical biological pattern, and protein-protein interaction analysis indicated that cellular function is not directly linked to promoter nucleotide structure. These results highlight the complexity of transcriptional regulation and suggest that promoter sequence alone may not predict functional protein associations.
