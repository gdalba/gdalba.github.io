  From the Editorial: "All of us, at some point or another, have been (or are, or will be) wrong in a belief. Sometimes the correction is quick and painless, but sometimes – often in cases where the belief has become a pillar of personal identity – it is neither. Sometimes these beliefs are considered sacred and not up for discussion. So how do we discuss the undiscussable? Guilherme Brambatti Guzzo and Gabriel Dall’Alba tackle this question in their article “The Role of Educators in Desacralizing Ideas,” on page 8. (Sneak preview: Do it gently!)".
