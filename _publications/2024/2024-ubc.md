  The genome of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi, a marine species of gelatinous zooplankton, was
  recently re-analyzed to obtain a more complete and gap-free DNA sequence. This updated survey
  uncovered an additional 50 million base pairs, expanding the known genetic material of this
  organism. Using state-of-the-art methods, we systematically labeled and interpreted different
  regions of the genome. We explored the repetitive sequences within the genome,
  providing insights into the evolutionary trajectory of ctenophore genomes. In addition, we
  successfully identified previously missing genes and analyzed complex regions of the genome that
  are traditionally difficult to resolve. Finally, through genomic comparative studies, the present M.
  leidyi assembly and annotation results are consistent with previous research placing the ctenophore
  as the earliest branching lineage in animal evolution.
