  In this article, we look at the literature to explore how big data technologies are being applied in biology. With the continuous growth of available data, the concept of big data has gained importance, supported by technologies like cloud computing for infrastructure and NoSQL for storage. We examine how machine learning methods—such as decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and clustering—are used for data analysis. Our goal is to provide a clear overview of how information technology concepts (like storage, analysis, and data sharing) are connected to and applied within biological research.
