  I explore the overlap between teaching practices in science classrooms with classic biotechnology examples. I first explore the philosophical background of science education and what epistemic virtues are best candidates to be integrated in classrooms. Then, I propose the activity of "thinking like a scientist", using insulin as a classic example of biotechnology advancements that allows students to step into the shoes of seasoned scientists. I finish with a philosophical reasoning exercise of why the activity is beneficial to the teaching of science.
