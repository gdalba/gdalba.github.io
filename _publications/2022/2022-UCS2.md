  We review the book Teaching evolution in a creation nation, by Harvey Siegel and Adam Laats (https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo22541379.html). We discuss how the book adds valuable insights that are helpful to the fostering of philosophy of education discussions, as it tackles a most controversial topic in its nature: the teaching of evolution in face of stonewalls placed by fundamentalist religion. The authors argue, and we agree, that teaching in scientific grounds must be made according to the strength of evidence in favour of an idea, not due to social or cultural reasons. And claiming that introducing evolution in schools is a social, not a scientific matter, is controversial.
