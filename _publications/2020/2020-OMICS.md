  There is a great unmet need for automation and algorithms to aid in analyses of big data, in biology in particular. We report here an original neural network approach for recognition and prediction of Bacillus subtilis promoters. The artificial neural network used as input 767 B. subtilis promoter sequences, while also aiming at identifying the architecture, provides the most optimal prediction. Two multilayer perceptron neural network architectures offered the highest accuracy, one with five, and another with seven neurons in the hidden layer. Each architecture achieved an accuracy of 98.57% and 97.69%, respectively. The results collectively indicate the promise of the application of neural network approaches to the B. subtilis promoter recognition problem, while also suggesting the broader potential of algorithms for automation of data analyses in the postgenomic era.
