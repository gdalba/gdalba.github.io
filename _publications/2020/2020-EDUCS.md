  We organized this book with the aim of bringing students and professionals from biology, computer science, and related fields closer to Bioinformatics, offering an overview of its concepts and applications through the expertise of professors and researchers from its various domains. We divided the book into two sections: Computational Foundations and Applications. Thus, the reader will first find a technical conceptualization of computational methodologies and approaches, followed by the ways in which these are employed in academic research. Additionally, the reader will find an up-to-date and exemplary reference from the literature on Bioinformatics. We hope that this book will further foster interest in Bioinformatics and serve as both an example and a theoretical reference regarding the important role this field has played — and will continue to play — in research, as well as its potential.
