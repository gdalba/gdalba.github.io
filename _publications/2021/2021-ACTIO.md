  Studying science means more than simply coming into contact with its products—that is, with ideas, hypotheses, theories, and scientific conclusions. It also involves understanding the processes through which scientific products are proposed, justified, evaluated, revised, established, or discarded. One of the most prominent ways to approach science as a process is through the study of historical cases. In this article, we argue that the novel coronavirus pandemic constitutes one such case, as it offers an interesting glimpse into at least three fundamental elements of scientific processes and, more broadly, the nature of science: the social character of the scientific enterprise, the caution required when dealing with claims of authority, and epistemic fallibilism. We identify and reflect on these three elements based on the work of scientists during the COVID-19 pandemic and, finally, offer suggestions on how they can be incorporated into science classes at schools and universities.
