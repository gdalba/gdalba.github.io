  In this article, we explore the fascinating case of Leon Festinger's "When we Become the Seekers". It serves as a scaffold to reason philosophically about our beliefs and how to navigate them. We dive deeply into the story of the so-called Seekers, and tackle ideas such as "A belief is a part of me, so what?". This article was featured and also is available in Audio edition.
