  Advances in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and omics sciences have driven the development of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, two fields with transformative potential in biotechnology. These technologies are being applied across industriesâ€”from reducing costs and environmental impact in biorefineries, to enabling gene therapies in medicine, and producing nutrients and additives in food through engineered microorganisms. This work aims to organize recent developments and applications in both fields, highlighting current innovations and future prospects that may shift technological and societal paradigms.
