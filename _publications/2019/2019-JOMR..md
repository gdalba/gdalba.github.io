  Currently, promoter prediction still poses many challenges due to the characteristics of these sequences. In this paper, the nucleotide content of Escherichia coli promoter sequences, related to five alternative σ factors, was analyzed by a machine learning technique in order to provide profiles according to the σ factor which recognizes them. For this, the clustering technique was applied since it is a viable method for finding hidden patterns on a data set. As a result, 20 groups of sequences were formed. Evidence was found of an overlap between the functions of the genes regulated by different σ factors, suggesting that DNA structural properties are also essential parameters for further studies. These found patterns should be considered for implementing computational prediction tools.
