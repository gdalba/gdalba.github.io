  This paper aims to present an analysis of publications related to Bioinformatics found on the Brazilian Biblioteca Digital de Teses e Dissertações (BDTD). In order to do this, we conducted a bibliometric study of quantitative nature and descriptive character. A total of 594 records were collected and quantified by the amount of publications, their type and the institution of origin. We identified that the main source of bioinformatics publications takes shape of master theses in the country. Also, biological structures prediction was the main topic found among the studies.
