  I provide a in-depth tutorial on how to use a clustering tool called DNA Sequences Clusterizer, created at the University of Caxias do Sul, and that I have extensively used during my undergraduate studies. It pipelines from data extraction to results analysis in a user-friendly way, with no coding needed.
