short_bio: >-
  I'm a biologist from Brazil 🇧🇷, and Master of Science from the <a href="https://www.gsat.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">Genome Science and Technology (GSAT)</a> program.
  </p>
  <p>
    I arrived in Canada 🇨🇦 in August 2020 and embarked on a journey to become a skillful scientist and member of the academic ecosphere of Vancouver. I bring collegiality, creativity, and a strong work ethic to my research and teaching. I am passionate about the intersection of science and education, and I strive to make a positive impact in both fields. 
  <p>
    A few professional passions can describe me:
  <p>
  👨‍🏫<strong style="color:#440154;">Teaching</strong>, where I have been a sessional lecturer for two courses at UBC: <a href="https://science.ubc.ca/students/SCIE113" target="_blank">First-year Seminar in Science (SCIE 113)</a> and <a href="https://biologyprogram-2023.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2023/02/Syllabus_BIOL180_2023.pdf" target="_blank">Thinking Like a Life Scientist (BIOL 180)</a>; I delivered guest lectures to <a href="https://biologyprogram-2023.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2022/09/Syllabus_BIOL336_2022.pdf" targed="_blank">Fundamentals of Evolutionary Biology (BIOL 336)</a>; I acted as a Teaching Assistant (TA) and TA coordinator for numerous courses across UBC's Biology Program, Biomedical Engineering (SBME), and Physics & Astronomy (PHYS) departments.
  <p>
  🔬<strong style="color:#472d7b;">Research</strong>, where I have been involved in various research projects, more recently with the genome annotation of a high-quality assembly of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi at the <a href="https://plotkinlab.phas.ubc.ca/" target=_blank">Plotkin lab</a>;
  <p>
  🧑‍🤝‍🧑<strong style="color:#3b528b;">Mentoring</strong>, where I have had the opportunity to mentor undergraduate and graduate students, young adults and adults alike to develop their skills, find their passions in life, and more;
  <p>
  🌍<strong style="color:#2c728e;">Outreach</strong>, where I have been involved in various outreach activities to promote science education, including through my science communication blog, <a href="https://nastrilhasdarazao.wordpress.com/" target=_blank">"On the Trails of Reason"</a> (language: Portuguese-Brazil).      
  <p>  
  🧬<Strong style="color:#21918c;">Interests (Bioinformatics / General Biology) </strong>: Evolutionary Biology, Genetics, Genomics, Data Science & Big Data for Biology.
  <p>
  🧠<Strong style="color:#28ae80;">Interests (Philosophy of Science & Education) </strong>: Critical Thinking for Science and Education, Fostering of Epistemic Virtues, Nature of Science, and Science Communication Strategies.
  </p>
  <p>
