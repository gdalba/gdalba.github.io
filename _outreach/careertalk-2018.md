I had the pleasure of speaking with a vocational group at my former university, a community of young adults exploring their passions and potential career paths. I was invited to share a bit about my undergraduate journey, answer their questions, and offer some perspective on the path of scientific studies.

It was a truly heartwarming experience. The groupâ€™s curiosity, honesty, and thoughtful questions reminded me how important these early conversations are. In the end, I probably learned just as much from them as they did from me.
