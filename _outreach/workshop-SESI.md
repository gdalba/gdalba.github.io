Through an invitation of Professor [Dr. Carla Eliana Todero Ritter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carla-eliana-todero-ritter-27142b66/) (who by the way, was also my elementary school science teacher!!!), we delivered a one afternoon-long workshop on practices to foster critical thinking and scientific thinking in K-12 (more specifically, High School) classrooms.

The workshop covered:
- Fostering of epistemic virtues (including: what are they, how to foster them, and examples)
- Mirroring the best practices you want students to pay attention to.
