In this talk at the CICE 2016 Conference, I discussed how bioinformatics tools can be integrated into science education to improve students' understanding of complex biological concepts. My philosophical framework in this case is called "Didactic Transposition", where educators pay close attention to potential deviations from subject matter as you try to find the appropriate vocabulary for your target audience.

It was also my first time in Canada, and that is when I fell in love with the country!

The presentation covered:
- Introduction to bioinformatics for educators
- The philosophical framework of Didactic Transposition
- Practical tools for classroom implementation
