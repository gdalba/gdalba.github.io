## Preface (Translated)

One of the great beauties of science—as well as of science education—is the abundance and ubiquity of what we call its products. From the fascinating ideas yet to be brought to life, to the hypotheses and theories that decode and explain the world around us, and finally, to the creations and inventions born from scientific endeavor: cell phones, vaccines, airplanes, trains, submarines, space stations, and telescopes that glimpse into the origins of our Universe.

But how can we possibly convey such richness within the bounds of a single school year? To approach this question, I recall an interview led by Prof. Guilherme Guzzo—one of the minds behind this work—with Canadian philosopher and writer Christopher DiCarlo. Both emphasize how educators are gifted with one of the privileges of science: its intrinsic power to fascinate.

In other words, a teacher does not need to try hard to reveal the beauty of the theory of evolution by natural selection, illustrated by observable examples in nature—like species that mimic others to avoid predation, or the emergence of molecules that transport oxygen throughout so many living organisms. There is no need to exaggerate to captivate when introducing the immune system and how it not only naturally protects us, but how we’ve also learned to enhance it through vaccines to combat diseases and global health crises like those we’ve faced in recent years.

Likewise, teachers need not strain to inspire when they describe the dazzling diversity of the animal and plant kingdoms. In presenting developmental models that result in the flowers that beautify our gardens and landscapes—or the equally fascinating mechanisms of pollen dispersal and their intimate relationships with insects and other pollinators, essential to the formation of natural landscapes—we awaken awe in students, many of whom at least appreciate their striking aesthetics.

Educators can also teach valuable lessons through the environmental changes our planet is undergoing. Whether through the shifting migratory patterns of sea turtles or the alterations in our atmosphere due to human emissions, these examples highlight the importance of observing nature as it is and of caring for what threatens it, if we wish for it to remain a home for life—human and otherwise.

These are just a few of the relevant topics this book aims to present in a simple yet scientifically sound manner, enabling educators to bring them into the classroom. Each chapter is written by professionals in the biological sciences, working across a range of equally fascinating areas. The aim of every contributor is the same: to make science education even more meaningful for the future citizens who will soon leave the classroom and enter the world.

This is achieved through theoretical discussions of specific topics, supported by examples that illustrate their scientific relevance and importance. Beyond that, each chapter includes a practical activity that can be developed in the classroom to reinforce the core messages discussed.

The student or teacher who engages with this book will come away empowered to carry the natural wonder of science into their own thinking—and potentially into classrooms across our country, which so urgently needs a renewed appreciation for the value of science.

Works like this are proof that the natural fascination with science is contagious. When given the chance, scientists are eager to sit down and write joyfully about what captivates them most. This, in itself, is a fundamental example of the importance of science education and the communication of scientific ideas. It makes perfect sense, then, that we—as scientists and educators—should dedicate our efforts, our passion, and our knowledge to creating science that can also be read in schools.
