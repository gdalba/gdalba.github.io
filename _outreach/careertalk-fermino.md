I had the privilege of speaking to the bright young minds at Escola Fermino Ferronato, thanks to a kind invitation from my dear friend and someone I deeply admire, Dr. Eduardo Echer dos Reis, a dedicated teacher at the school.

Coming from humble beginnings, my journey to Canada has been shaped by hard work, a passion for science, and a great deal of persistence. I shared a bit of that path with the studentsâ€”hoping to inspire, but truthfully, I left just as inspired by their curiosity, questions, and perspectives.

It was a rewarding exchange, and a reminder of the importance of connecting with and supporting the next generation.
