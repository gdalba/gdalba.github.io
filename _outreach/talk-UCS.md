In this talk sponsored by the University of Caxias do Sul (through the 8th Seminar on Technology, Innovation, and Social Development), Dr. Guilherme Brambatti Guzzo and I discussed, through case studies, the philosophical reasons that lend support as to why can we trust science.

The presentation covered:
- Introduction to science and the nature of science.
- Case studies across history that illustrates the nature of science.
- Counterargument to common misconceptions that cast shadow about the reliability of science.
