Back in 2019, my colleague and friend Guilherme Brambatti Guzzo and I often talked about starting a student-led academic group — something like an academic league (similar to university clubs in North America). Eventually, we spread the word and gathered for our first meeting at a campus café.

It was an incredible experience.

Each week, participants would bring topics to the table, anything from the latest biology news to book chapters across diverse scientific fields. Our aim was simple but meaningful: to create a welcoming space for open, curious, and thoughtful discussions. We also fostered the interaction with the English language, in attempts to enhance the scope of knowledge from every participant. I was a member until I moved to Canada, in 2020.
