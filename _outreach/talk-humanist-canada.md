In this talk at the Webinar Series of the Humanist Canada institution, I teamed up with the fantastic Dr. Christopher DiCarlo and Dr. Guilherme Brambatti Guzzo to discuss how both historical and recent (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) events can teach us a lot about how science operates.

The presentation covered:
- Introduction to science and the nature of science.
- Case studies across history that illustrates the nature of science.
- COVID-19 case studies that illustrates the nature of science.
