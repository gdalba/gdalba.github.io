My role involved coordinating communication with all contributing authors to ensure timely submissions and revisions, overseeing a rigorous double-blind peer review process to maintain academic integrity, compiling and formatting the final manuscript including all figures and supplementary materials, and serving as the primary liaison with the publisher throughout the editorial and production stages. I also created the visual art for the cover, which was then used as template for later publications.
