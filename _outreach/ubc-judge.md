In this fascinating day, I teamed up with prestigious faculty at UBC to evaluate the fantastic work done by UBC science students. They tackled the topic "How can we effectively tackle the challenges to achieving universal access to clean drinking water in Canada?" through a miriad of different angles, from integration of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to access to clean water and sanitation services in schools.

I got to ask some fascinating questions and hear the students sharing their thoughts on the spot and to learn a lot!
