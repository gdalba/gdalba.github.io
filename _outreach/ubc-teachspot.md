[Takuji Usui](https://takujiusui.github.io/) and I were invited to talk about some of the activities that involves inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA) we used to conduct as Teaching Assistants of the course BIOL 336 - Fundamentals of Evolutionary Biology, at The University of British Columbia. We discussed the philosophy behind why we do it the way we do, what we hope students learn, and what we observe and learn ourselves in the process (and, of course, much more!).
