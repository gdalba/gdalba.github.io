Finally, Gabriel went above and beyond by making powerpoints for each tutorial, which helped further my understanding.\nAn excellent TA; probably one of the best teaching assistants I've ever had."

            "Gabriel was a great TA who was always friendly, patient, and open to student questions. He was evidently deeply passionate about evolutionary biology and that enthusiasm\nshowed in his teaching and class discussions. My only critique of Gabriel as a TA is that sometimes he got a little too passionate about the course material and would\noccasionally go a bit over the allotted class time, but his tutorials were always interesting so I did not mind. All in all, Gabriel's tutorials were well\u2013run, informative, and engaging,\nmaking my experience in BIOL 336 tutorials a very positive one",
            "Great tutorial lectures and introduced many topics and ideas tying philosophy and evolution together, was very eye opening and informative. Loved learning about different\napplication of evolution, and deep conversations about evolutionary biology.",
            "Gabriel is amazingly amazing! He explained things so well and he was super considerate. Since tutorial 1 he made the environment seem super welcoming and safe. The\ninsights he gives throughout tutorials are great."

            "Gabriel was very engaged and intered in the teaching this course. Every lecture was well thought out and I enjoyed his enthusiam in the course.",
            "Gabriel is literally the best prof I've seen in UBC so far. Very helpful, friendly, and cooperative.",

            "Gabriel would make a great deal of effort to support his students and took a big step up after losing our previous teacher. He was very considerate when coming to teach us and has done a great job so far.",
            "Mr Dall'Alba is incredibly passionate about teaching and the philosophical side of science, which made classes engaging and incredibly interested. I enjoyed the additional real\u2013world examples that he added into his slides, and I enjoyed listening to his relevant experiences as a student, researcher, and teacher.",
            "Gabriel did an excellent job picking up the course in Dr. Pete's absence, and was very understanding of the adjustment period, and taking each in class with grace. Gabriel was fantastic to interact with, and gave detailed feedback for writing assignments. Overall I enjoyed Gabriel and the way he ran the remainder of the class.",
            "Professor Dall'Alba showed a lot of interest in teaching the course and gave great feedback. His lessons are well planned and I enjoyed attending the classes."

            "He is one of the nicest instructor I ever had. He always choses words that very mindful and kind, and it made the atmosphere /attitude of the class more respectful. I usually do not raise my hands in other classes because I am usually not confident or brave enough, but in this class, I know that he tries to expand/interpret the ideas that I talked. So I was able to raise my hands a lot in this class. He is also very helpful in his office hours and his responses on the worksheets. also, he is very passionate about the topics covered in this class a lot. I used to hear that most of people do not care about scie 113, but he made this class very engaging.",
            "Thank you so much for making scie113 such a nice class! Wish you all the best:)",
            "Overall does a good job at prompting discussion and is very understanding of each student as an individual \u2013 in terms of their unique circumstances and perspectives",
            "The instructor did an incredibly good job at inspiring students and relating course material and discussion to relevant science. The instructor was very respectful of his students, which led to a constructive classroom environment that facilitated learning.",
            "Professor Dall'Alba was very willing to help me when I encountered challenges throughout my assignments. When I needed advice on how to communicate an idea for an essay, he was very helpful and patient during office hours. He was overall very approachable and open\u2013minded which encouraged me to keep doing my best. Essay writing is not my strong suit, but my instructor made sure to also give positive feedback and not just negative feedback.",
            "He was always super super enthusiastic to teach + I felt like I could talk to him as a friend and he was really supportive all throughout term. I was scared at first because most people say he's a tough grader but I never felt that way at all, and his feedback was always centered positively/very very constructive and gentle criticism which I think really improved my writing. I loved this class!!",
            "Gabriel was very encouraging and kind throughout the term. He made his expectations for the course very clear and gave very valuable feedback to improve our learning.",
            "I really appreciate all the comment that the instructor have for me and every time when we have idea, we will discuss it together I think that is really useful and help me develop my thought on different perspectives.",
            "Gabriel was a super supportive instructor, and he was always an open person to talk to! He supported me in and out of class, and he was extremely accessible for the numerous questions I had. Overall, Gabriel is a very kind instructor who really cared about my learning.",
            "Gabriel was super supportive and helpful throughout the semester. He was available outside office hours and granted one\u2013on\u2013one feedback sessions which helped a great deal. Gabriel was also very understanding and empathetic towards his students situations and circumstances.",
            "The instructor discussed complex and nuanced topics in a digestible and accessible format. He additionally provided effective examples and case studies to demonstrate these concepts and showed genuine interest in our learning."
