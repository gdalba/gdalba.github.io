            "actually have no suggestions for what Gabriel could do better. Gabriel's enthusiasm for science is contagious, and he is excellent at explaining concepts. His thorough feedback\non my assignments helped improve my scientific writing. Finally, Gabriel went above and beyond by making powerpoints for each tutorial, which helped further my understanding.\nAn excellent TA; probably one of the best teaching assistants I've ever had."

            "Gabriel was a great TA who was always friendly, patient, and open to student questions. He was evidently deeply passionate about evolutionary biology and that enthusiasm\nshowed in his teaching and class discussions. My only critique of Gabriel as a TA is that sometimes he got a little too passionate about the course material and would\noccasionally go a bit over the allotted class time, but his tutorials were always interesting so I did not mind. All in all, Gabriel's tutorials were well\u2013run, informative, and engaging,\nmaking my experience in BIOL 336 tutorials a very positive one",
            "Great tutorial lectures and introduced many topics and ideas tying philosophy and evolution together, was very eye opening and informative. Loved learning about different\napplication of evolution, and deep conversations about evolutionary biology.",
            "Gabriel is amazingly amazing! He explained things so well and he was super considerate. Since tutorial 1 he made the environment seem super welcoming and safe. The\ninsights he gives throughout tutorials are great."

            "He is one of the nicest instructor I ever had. He always choses words that very mindful and kind, and it made the atmosphere /attitude of the class more respectful. I usually do not raise my hands in other classes because I am usually not confident or brave enough, but in this class, I know that he tries to expand/interpret the ideas that I talked. So I was able to raise my hands a lot in this class. He is also very helpful in his office hours and his responses on the worksheets. also, he is very passionate about the topics covered in this class a lot. I used to hear that most of people do not care about scie 113, but he made this class very engaging.",

When I needed advice on how to communicate an idea for an essay, he was very helpful and patient during office hours. He was overall very approachable and open\u2013minded which encouraged me to keep doing my best. Essay writing is not my strong suit, but my instructor made sure to also give positive feedback and not just negative feedback.",
            "He was always super super enthusiastic to teach + I felt like I could talk to him as a friend and he was really supportive all throughout term. I was scared at first because most people say he's a tough grader but I never felt that way at all, and his feedback was always centered positively/very very constructive and gentle criticism which I think really improved my writing. I loved this class!!",
